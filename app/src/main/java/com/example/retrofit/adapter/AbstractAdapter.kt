    *   I consider how bad is this styling of code and how dirty is it.
    *   I consider how bad my code right now.
    *   But unfortunately, i'm new with Android Studio and Kotlin Programming Language.
    *   Made my codes limited, dirty, and kinda "noobish".
    *   If you read this, please teach me :( I need more study
    *   I'm sorry... Once again... I'm sorry for dirty codes
