    I was planning to clean my code by make my adapter abstract, just i don't know how to use this....
    So in the end, i will do this:

                                AbstractAdapter
                                     /\
                                    /  \
                                   /    \
                         DatasAdapter   CardViewAdapter

    With this design pattern, i could create
    some Factory, so it will be the end of Shotgun Surgery at ShowData Activity.    -> showData()

    I created some duplicate code in MainActivity where showData should be a single function
        with calling some Factory and end with Polymorphism

    Another Duplicate Code found in CardViewAdapter and DatasAdapter.
        You will consider that the only changes happen at Class Name, onBindViewHolder, and Handler(){}
    
    
    If you read this, please open my AbstractAdapter class for more detail.
